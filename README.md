# Instructions:
  - Use the dataset provided (data.js) to create an automatic table, and to have the user be able to search for sitings based criteria inputted by the user.
  
## Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)
  - Create a basic HTML web page or use the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).
  - Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
    - Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.
  - Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
  
## Level 2:
  - Complete Level 1
  - Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

## How to Run Code:
  1. Clone the Repository onto your local machine.
  2. Open up the Repository and go into "UFO_Level_1" and double-click the index.html file.
  3. Test out the Web page!
  4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 for "UFO_Level_2"
